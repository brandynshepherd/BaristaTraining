                <time>Step 1: Flavor</time> The base for any Mocha is flavoring! In a standard medium Mocha about 120 mL of syrup flavoring is added to the bottom of the cup.

                <time>Step 2: Espresso</time> The most important part is the espresso. Bad espresso means a bad Mocha. Two shots pulled between 17-22 seconds is required for a medium sized Mocha.

                <time>Step 3: Milk</time> Almost as critical is the milk, since it makes up the majority of the drink. Steaming should start in the middle of the pitcher and stop when the temperature of the milk reaches 160 degrees.
